# Ultrasonic_DistanceAlarmSystem
Ultrasonic distance measurement system with LCD display and buzzer alert, built using Arduino.

# Ultrasonic Distance Alarm System ðŸš¨

This project is an **Arduino-based distance measuring and alarm system**.  
It uses an **HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor** to measure the distance of objects.  
The measured distance is shown on a **16x2 LCD Display**, and if the object comes too close, a **buzzer alarm** is triggered.

---

## ðŸ“· Overview
- Measures distance using ultrasonic waves.  
- Displays the distance in **centimeters** on an LCD screen.  
- Sounds a buzzer alarm when an object is closer than a set threshold.
